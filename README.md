# AI High-Frequency Trading (HFT) System with Quantum Computing Enhancements

## Overview

This project develops an AI-driven High-Frequency Trading (HFT) system leveraging quantum computing for enhanced data processing, optimization, and strategy development capabilities. The system integrates advanced machine learning techniques, including NLP and reinforcement learning, with quantum algorithms to optimize trading strategies, manage risks, and execute trades at high speed.

### Key Features

- Real-time market data ingestion and processing.
- NLP for sentiment analysis from financial news and social media.
- Reinforcement learning for dynamic trading strategy optimization.
- Quantum optimization algorithms for feature selection, model parameter tuning, and risk management.
- Quantum simulation for realistic backtesting and market scenario analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
